# Verity Stothard - Code Challange ðŸ‘‹

## Tech choices

Having worked predominantly with Vue, I opted to use Vue in this challange (as instructed by Matt Colman), as I felt it would best showcase my current skillset. 

I opted to work with the Nuxt framework for this challange, as features such as the Vuex store and Tailwind configuration come setup out of the box, enabiling me to focus my time on showcaseing my ability to build the application.

Please note that I do not have access to photoshop on my system, and therefore opted to use Tailwinds default values for things like spacing and text sizes. While it may not be `pixel perfect`, I believe this gives the app a clean and consistent appearance that works well across device sizes âœ¨

Thank you for taking the time to review my work, I look forward to speaking with you soon.

## Running the project

To run the project locally, please use the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
